RETR_EXTERNAL:
If you use this flag, it returns only extreme outer flags. All child cnts are left behind.
We can say, under this law, Only the eldest in every family is taken care of.
It doesn't care about other members of the family :).

CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE:
we need just two end points of that line. This is what cv.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE does.
It removes all redundant points and compresses the contour, thereby saving memory.

Reason is from real life, because there are many examples where people mar outside the circle.

The cv2.findContours  function doesn’t care if the bubble is “round”, “perfectly round”, or “oh my god, what the hell is that?”.

Instead, the cv2.findContours  function will return a set of blobs to you, which will be the foreground regions in your image.
